# Jonny's Simpons Quotes!

**General Info:** Jonny's Simpsons Quotes is a front-end project built to interface with and display data from a REST API (specifically, <a href="https://thesimpsonsquoteapi.glitch.me/">The Simpons Quote API</a>).  The Website processes the data and displays it in a themetically appropriate format for users to view.

**Vision and Motive:** This was a relatively early project of mine, built with a goal of learning how to consume REST APIs.  I find designing and consuming REST APIs fascinating apps to build and topics to study, because they spark my imagination with regard to the possible ways to provide information by dynamically generating and consuming data and sending it to wherever it needs ot go - this is the magic and power of the internet realized! 

**Tech Info:** Querrying the API returns a series of random quote objects from the database that contain the body of the quotes, as well as info about who said the quote and a URL of an image of the speaker.  Jonny's Simpsons Quotes makes a fetch call to the API, the API responds with the random quote returns in JSON format.  This response is then parsed into regular JavaScript and dynamically rendered as a component on the page.

Jonny's Simpsons Quotes is built with a component-based library similar to React.
